    <!-- History -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        The New Camo was founded in Johannesburg by <b>Wyvern Devenport</b>, a young designer driven by the belief that fashion should be more than clothing — it should be a voice. Inspired by creatives like Rick Owens, Le Fleur, Osbat, and Chrome Hearts, Wyvern set out to merge global streetwear with South Africa’s own urban energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rooted in Braamfontein’s youth culture, The New Camo grew from an idea among friends into collections that embody exclusivity, rebellion, and individuality. From handcrafted designs to limited drops, every piece is made to stand apart and spark conversation.
